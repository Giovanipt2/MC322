# OOP-Monopoly-Game

This repository contains a simplified version of the classic **Monopoly** board game, developed as an individual project for the **MC322 - Object-Oriented Programming** course at Unicamp. The objective was to apply the main concepts learned throughout the course in the design and implementation of a complete object-oriented application.

## Project Overview

The game follows the traditional rules of Monopoly, including rent collection, jail, and bankruptcy. The implementation simulates gameplay mechanics for multiple players, with a focus on modularity and code reusability.

## Topics Covered

- **Object-Oriented Programming**: Classes, inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism  
- **Game Mechanics**: Turn-based system, dice rolling, property management  
- **Design Patterns**: Clean architecture and separation of concerns  
- **Modular Development**: Organized codebase and logical structure
